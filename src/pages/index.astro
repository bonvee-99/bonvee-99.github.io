      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>
	I'm Ben Vinnick, a recent Computer Science graduate, based in Vancouver, BC. With hands-on experience as a Software Developer Intern and a Teaching Assistant at the University of British Columbia, I’ve gained the skills to be an impactful contributor no matter the team I’m on.
      </p>
      <p>
	At TAIT, I worked on both frontend and backend systems, creating user-friendly dashboards, optimizing media storage, and enhancing asset management workflows. As a Teaching Assistant, I guided hundreds of students through foundational programming concepts, helping them build confidence in topics like recursion, graph traversal, and debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
	After just completing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I’m continuing to work toward becoming a Software Architect, eager to design scalable systems and deliver meaningful, innovative solutions.</p>
